.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS

The Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices. This provides the network architecture for {partner-product-short-name} deployment.*
* An internet gateway to provide access to the internet.*
* In the public subnets, managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* An AWS CodePipeline pipeline that builds a Docker image and uploads it into an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository that interfaces with AWS Batch and runs in the {partner-product-short-name} AMI.
* Two AWS Batch compute environments: one for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Spot instances and the other for On-Demand instances. In the default setting, On-Demand instances have been prioritized over Spot instances. In order to reduce computation cost, you can prioritize Spot instances over On-Demand instances by updating the compute environment order under the Job Queue option of AWS Batch in the console.
* An AWS Batch job queue that prioritizes submission to the compute environment for Spot Instances to optimize for cost.
* An AWS Batch job definition to run {partner-product-short-name}.
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies for the AWS Batch jobs to run.

*{sp}The template that deploys the Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the tasks marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.
