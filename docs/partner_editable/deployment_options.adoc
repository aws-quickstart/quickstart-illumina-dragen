This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy DRAGEN into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys DRAGEN into this new VPC.
* *Deploy DRAGEN into an existing VPC*. This option provisions DRAGEN in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and DRAGEN settings, as discussed later in this guide.
