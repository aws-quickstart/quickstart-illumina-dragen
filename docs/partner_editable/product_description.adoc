This Quick Start was created to get you up and running with {partner-product-short-name} Bio-It Platform on AWS.
{partner-product-short-name} offerings enable ultra-rapid analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, and significantly reduce the time
required to analyze genomic data while also improving accuracy.

It includes bioinformatics pipelines that
provide highly optimized algorithms for mapping, aligning, sorting,
duplicate marking, and haplotype variant calling. These pipelines include Germline, Somatic (tumor and tumor/normal),
RNA, Single Cell RNA, Methylation, Joint Genotyping, and DRAGEN-GATK.
The {partner-product-short-name} mapping and variant calling pipelines have improved accuracy in calling single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions and deletions (INDELs) compared with industry standards. For
performance results, see the https://www.illumina.com/science/genomics-research/dragen-wins-precisionfda-challenge-showcase-accuracy-gains.html[PrecisionFDA Truth Challenge V2^],
where DRAGEN won best performance in all regions and difficult-to-map regions categories.
