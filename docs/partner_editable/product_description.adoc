This Quick Start was created to get you up and running with {partner-product-short-name} Complete Suite (CS) on AWS.
{partner-product-short-name} CS offerings enable ultra-rapid analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, and significantly reduce the time
required to analyze genomic data while also improving accuracy.

{partner-product-short-name} CS includes http://edicogenome.com/pipelines/[many bioinformatics pipelines^] that
harness the power of the {partner-product-short-name} platform and provide highly optimized algorithms for mapping, aligning, sorting,
duplicate marking, and haplotype variant calling. These pipelines include {partner-product-short-name} Germline V2, {partner-product-short-name} Somatic V2
(Tumor and Tumor/Normal), {partner-product-short-name} Virtual Long Read Detection (VLRD), {partner-product-short-name} RNA Gene Fusion, {partner-product-short-name} Joint Genotyping,
and GATK Best Practices. The {partner-product-short-name} Germline V2 and {partner-product-short-name} Somatic V2 pipelines have improved accuracy in calling single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions and deletions (INDELs) compared with industry standards. For
